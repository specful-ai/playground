# playground

This repo is a playground for experimenting with an AI coding bot powered by static code analysis and large language models. Follow the steps below to let the AI bot write some code for you.

Currently the playground only supports the Go programming language. If you have any ideas or comments, use [Discussions](https://github.com/specful-ai/playground/discussions) to let us know.

## Step 1. Create a new issue

## Step 3. A bot will pick up the issue and lock it.
Just sit back and wait for the bot to finish its work.

## Step 4. Once the bot finishes its work, it will convert the issue into a pull request and unlock it.
